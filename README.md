# I3-Initiative
This repository contains code required for tagging in an Illinois resource map used for the "I3: Inclusive, Inquiry-Based Social Studies for Illinois" initiative. By granting hundreds of K-12 teachers quick access to topic-sorted local organizations, this project aims to facilitate the process of finding relevant historical and cultural resources for teachers.
